# Pandas-Pipeline
Pandas is one of the most popular data manipulation and analysis tools available, known for its ease of use and powerful capabilities. But did you know that you can also use it to create and execute data pipelines for processing and analyzing datasets?

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Pandas' `pipe` method to build end-to-end data science pipelines. The pipeline includes various steps like data ingestion, data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization. To highlight the benefits of this approach, we will also compare pipeline-based code with non-pipeline alternatives, giving you a clear understanding of the differences and advantages.


## What is a Pandas Pipe?

The Pandas `pipe` method is a powerful tool that allows users to chain multiple data processing functions in a clear and readable manner. This method can handle both positional and keyword arguments, making it flexible for various custom functions. 

In short, Pandas `pipe` method:

  1.Enhances Code Readability /n
  2.Enables Function Chaining 
  3.Accommodates Custom Functions
  4.Improves Code Organization
  5.Efficient for Complex Transformations
